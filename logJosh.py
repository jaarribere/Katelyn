Script to perform automatic reporting of another python script when invoked. This script will:
(1) Create a file with filename including script used, and date/time
(2) Will create two versions of the file above, one .log, the other .cmd.
    .log contains stdout
    .cmd contains the command run by the

The goal in doing this is to know the precise origins of any given file. I will at least know the command
that was run to generate a file at the time that file was generated.

This was originally adapted from a script from Jason Merkin.
EDIT: Oct 4, 2013 - JOSH revised to make output logs in the directory where python is called. This makes
    trying to identify the command used to make a given file that much easier.
